The deployed web app is accessible via this URL:

### Just to note:
- The server is very limited in memory so until I find a better alternative, I'll turn off fetching of css files. This means the html pages would look sorta ugly, but at least the info is still there -)
- The web app uses a shared memory (of course due to memory limitations), so when one person fetches the recent projects every other user can download the zipped output. Also, each user can see the ongoing progress when any other user is fetching.
