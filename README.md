The deployed web app is accessible via this URL:

### Updates
- Cool new feature: Generates an offline html contents page where the projects are listed according to how they were released (very helpful if you want to study from beginning and follow up in sequence to date). The listing is in clickable link form, so you can easily navigate to the offline project file.
- Zipped archive now compressed.

### Just to note:
- The web app uses a shared memory (of course due to memory limitations), so when one person fetches the recent projects every other user can download the zipped output. Also, each user can see the ongoing progress when any other user is fetching.
