The deployed web app is accessible via this URL:

### Updates
- Zipped archive now compressed.

### Just to note:
- The web app uses a shared memory (of course due to memory limitations), so when one person fetches the recent projects every other user can download the zipped output. Also, each user can see the ongoing progress when any other user is fetching.
